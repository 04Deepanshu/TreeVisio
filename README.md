# TreeVisio

TREEVISIO is an innovative and versatile project designed to provide users with a comprehensive understanding of different tree data structures, including Binary Search Trees (BST), Binary Trees, and Max Heap Trees. This dynamic application allows users to input an array of elements and interactively visualize the construction and properties of these trees.

With TREEVISIO, users can explore the power of Binary Search Trees, which offer efficient search, insertion, and deletion operations. By inputting an array, users can witness how the BST algorithm organizes the elements in a hierarchical manner, with values less than the parent node placed on the left and values greater on the right. This visual representation helps users comprehend the sorted nature of the BST, enabling them to appreciate its balanced structure and the resulting improved search performance.

In addition to BST, TREEVISIO also showcases Binary Trees, which are non-linear data structures comprising nodes that can have at most two child nodes. By visualizing the Binary Tree construction, users can gain insights into the hierarchical relationships between elements, paving the way for further exploration of tree traversal algorithms and data manipulation techniques.

Furthermore, TREEVISIO introduces users to Max Heap Trees, a specialized binary tree where the parent node always holds a value greater than or equal to its children. By inputting an array, users can observe how the Max Heap Tree algorithm organizes the elements, ensuring that the maximum value resides at the root. This visualization provides an excellent opportunity to understand the heap property and explore the efficiency of priority-based operations.

With its user-friendly interface and interactive visualization capabilities, TREEVISIO empowers users to deepen their understanding of these important tree data structures. By providing a hands-on experience in constructing and exploring Binary Search Trees, Binary Trees, and Max Heap Trees, TREEVISIO serves as a valuable learning tool for students, developers, and tree enthusiasts alike.
